# Flexible Delete System - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented a configurable soft/hard delete system for diary entries with authentication protection, comprehensive logging, and audit trails.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates ✅
**File**: `schema.sql`
- Added `deletion_type` ENUM ('soft', 'hard')
- Added `deletion_type` column to `ingest_item` table (default: 'soft')
- Added `deleted_at` TIMESTAMPTZ column
- Added index on `deletion_type` for deleted items

**Migration**: `web/diary/migrations/0001_add_deletion_tracking.py`
- Successfully applied to database
- Creates ENUM type and adds columns
- Includes reverse migration for rollback

### 2. Configuration System ✅
**File**: `web/diary/diary_config.py`
- Configurable deletion mode via `DIARY_DELETION_MODE` environment variable
- Default: 'soft' delete (safe, recoverable)
- Validation of configuration values
- Future-ready for 'hard' delete mode

### 3. Business Logic Layer ✅
**File**: `web/diary/services.py`
- `delete_item()`: Handles both soft and hard deletion
- `get_deleted_items()`: Query soft-deleted items (for future Trash page)
- `restore_item()`: Restore soft-deleted items (for future feature)
- Comprehensive logging with audit trail

### 4. Web Interface ✅
**Views** (`web/diary/views.py`):
- `delete_item_view()`: Authenticated-only endpoint
- Proper error handling (404, 500)
- Detailed logging of all delete operations

**URLs** (`web/diary_site/urls.py`):
- DELETE endpoint: `/api/delete/<uuid:item_id>/`
- Protected by authentication

**Template** (`web/templates/diary/home.html`):
- Delete buttons (visible only to authenticated users)
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- AJAX-based deletion with smooth fade-out animation
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 5. Logging ✅
**File**: `common/logging_utils/logging_config.py`
- Added "diary" logger
- Logs saved to `logs/diary.log`
- Tracks all delete operations, successes, and failures

## How to Use

### Starting the Server
```powershell
cd web
python manage.py runserver
```

### Deleting Entries
1. Navigate to home page: http://localhost:8000/
2. Login with your account
3. Each diary entry shows a "Delete" button (top-right)
4. Click "Delete" → Confirmation dialog appears
5. Confirm → Entry is soft-deleted and fades out
6. Entry disappears from all views

### Configuration

Set deletion mode in environment variable or `.env` file:
```bash
# Soft delete (default, recommended)
DIARY_DELETION_MODE=soft

# Hard delete (future feature)
# DIARY_DELETION_MODE=hard
```

## Database State After Deletion

### Soft Delete (Current Default)
```sql
is_deleted = true
deletion_type = 'soft'
deleted_at = '2025-10-30 08:30:15 UTC'
```

Entry is hidden from views but remains in database for recovery.

### Recovery Process (If Needed)
```sql
-- Restore accidentally deleted entry
UPDATE ingest_item 
SET is_deleted = false, deleted_at = NULL 
WHERE id = '<uuid>';
```

### View Deleted Items
```sql
-- See all soft-deleted items
SELECT id, title, content_text, deleted_at 
FROM ingest_item 
WHERE is_deleted = true AND deletion_type = 'soft'
ORDER BY deleted_at DESC;
```

## Security Features
✅ Login required for delete operations  
✅ CSRF protection on all POST requests  
✅ UUID validation (prevents SQL injection)  
✅ Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion  
✅ Audit trail via `deleted_at` timestamp and logs  
✅ Soft delete preserves data for recovery  

## Technical Architecture

### Deletion Workflow
1. User clicks "Delete" button
2. JavaScript shows confirmation dialog
3. On confirm: AJAX POST to `/api/delete/<item_id>/`
4. Backend: 
   - Validates authentication
   - Looks up item (only non-deleted items)
   - Calls `delete_item()` service
   - Sets `is_deleted=true`, `deletion_type='soft'`, `deleted_at=now()`
   - Saves with `update_fields` for efficiency
   - Logs operation
5. Frontend:
   - Receives success response
   - Fades out card (300ms animation)
   - Removes from DOM
   - Reloads if page becomes empty

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented Yet)

### Phase 2 (Optional)
- ⏸️ **Trash Page**: View all soft-deleted items
- ⏸️ **Restore Button**: Undo deletion from Trash page
- ⏸️ **Hard Delete**: Admin-only permanent deletion
- ⏸️ **Bulk Operations**: Delete/restore multiple items at once
- ⏸️ **Auto-Cleanup**: Cron job to purge old soft-deletes (90+ days)
- ⏸️ **User Ownership**: Users can only delete their own entries

### Switching to Hard Delete
To enable hard delete mode in the future:
1. Set `DIARY_DELETION_MODE=hard` in `.env`
2. Entries will be physically removed from database
3. Cannot be recovered after deletion

## Testing Checklist

✅ Migration applied successfully  
✅ No linter errors  
✅ Django system check passes  
✅ Delete button appears (authenticated users only)  
✅ Confirmation dialog works  
✅ AJAX request properly formatted (CSRF token)  
✅ Entry fades out and disappears  
✅ Database updated correctly (is_deleted, deletion_type, deleted_at)  
✅ Logs track deletion operations  
✅ Error handling works (404 for non-existent items)
