Path Utilities Module

This module provides cross-platform path handling utilities for the entire pipeline.
It supports both regular Python execution and PyInstaller frozen applications, ensuring 
consistent path resolution across different platforms.

Key Features:
- Cross-platform path resolution (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- PyInstaller frozen application support
- Relative and absolute path handling
- Directory creation and validation
- Filename sanitization for filesystem safety
- Script directory detection for both regular and frozen execution

The utilities handle:
- Path resolution with proper base directory handling
- Directory creation with parent directory support
- Script directory detection for frozen applications
- Filename sanitization to prevent filesystem issues

    Resolve a path, handling both relative and absolute paths.
    
    This function provides cross-platform path resolution that works consistently
    in both regular Python execution and PyInstaller frozen applications. It
    properly handles relative paths by resolving them against a base directory.
    
    The resolution process:
    1. Uses script directory as base if no base_dir provided
    2. Converts string inputs to Path objects
    3. Returns absolute paths as-is (resolved)
    4. Resolves relative paths against the base directory
    
    Args:
        path_input (Union[str, Path]): Input path as string or Path object
        base_dir (Optional[Path]): Base directory for relative paths.
                                 Defaults to script directory if None
        
    Returns:
        Path: Resolved Path object (always absolute)
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If the path cannot be resolved due to invalid input
        OSError: If the path resolution fails due to filesystem issues

    Ensure a directory exists, creating it if necessary.
    
    This function creates a directory and all necessary parent directories

    The creation process:
    1. Converts input to Path object
    2. Checks if directory already exists
    3. Creates directory with all parent directories if needed
    4. Returns the Path object pointing to the directory
    
    Args:
        directory_path (Union[str, Path]): Path to the directory to ensure
        
    Returns:

    The sanitization process:
    1. Replaces unsafe characters (< > : " / \\ | ? *) with underscores
    2. Removes leading/trailing whitespace and dots
    3. Ensures filename is not empty (uses 'unnamed_file' if empty)
